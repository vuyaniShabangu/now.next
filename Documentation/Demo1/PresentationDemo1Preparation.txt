PLANNING, STRATEGY AND METHODOLOGY (Vuyani)

Methodology
For the development of this project, we have adopted the Scrum framework of the Agile Methodology.
In our initial meeting with the client last week, we discussed broadly the full scope of the project and formed a Product Backlog. Throughout the course of this project we will be having bi-weekly meetings which will serve as Sprint planning sessions. Our first sprint planning sessions will be this Friday (later today) and where we will go in depth on a certain portion of the functionality (web portal). 

We plan on starting with the easier tasks to give us more time to research on the technologies of the more complicated tasks.

As a development team we will be meeting everyday to code together for a period of atlas 2  to 4 hours. Individual coding can be done after that but it is important to have these group coding sessions to ensure that we are still on the same page. This is taken from experience from our mini project.

These daily sessions will start of with a 15 minute Scrum meeting, where we will discuss:
What each person did yesterday?
What each person is doing today?
Any challenges/problems that anyone is facing.

We will be using Waffle.io for our chanson chart as well as burndown chart.

To keep to the spirit of agile, which is close interaction with the client, we have invited the client to watch out git repository, as well as our Waffle.io charts.
We have also invited them to our Slack group where we talk to them frequently on progress and other issues.
Project Planning.
We aim to complete this project well before the deadline so that any underlying issues can be solved in time. 
{Gannt Chart}
Each member of the team has been assigned a research topic of some of the more technically demanding aspects of the project such as
-Drone auto-pilot control
-Image recognition
-Drone control
-Orthophotography
-point-cloud from image

Technical Challenges
Integrating with a lot of hardware such as Pixhawk autopilot will be a challenge but we are solving it by playing around with the it now before the actual Sprint. So that by the time the Sprint comes we have some code that will show some understanding as well as a proper understanding of how it works.

New Technology platform 
Heroic will be our server for this project. None of us have worked with Heroku, therefore we have spent the last week learning the learning about it and playing with it.
