This will make it much accessible for you and companies to have such services at a click of a button to the online portal through a browser, and later receive the result of missions you created and submitted to dronr. All missions are to be completed by drone operators then submit results to dronr, which broadcasts them to your portal after being notified that your mission has been completed.
